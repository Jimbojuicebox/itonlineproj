# IT Online Learning Web Coding Prjoect

This small site is a display of the skills learnt so far on the Coding Course from IT Online Learning.
It is a simple landing page detailing a small amount of information about myself and what you hope to learn/certications you gain whilst on the course.
Brief site structure is:

- Header including navigation bar
- hero/intro to page
- skills you hope to learn on the course
- certifications you can acheive on the course
- a php powered contact form should you want further info about the course

## JavScript
JavaScript has been utilised to add animation to hero image and slide in effects for various elements as you scroll down the page. There is also 'typing' effect on the home section that cycles through aspects of the course.

## CSS
I have tried to use some modern css to make the site appear modern and stylish. Mainly trying out a technique known as Glassmorphism.

## Responsive
I have tried to make the site responsive to all devices through the use of break points and flexbox. Adjusting font size and element sizes to better fit the size of screen.
